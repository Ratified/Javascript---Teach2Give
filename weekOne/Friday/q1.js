//1. Write a JavaScript program to list the properties of a JavaScript object.

let student = {
    name : "David Rayy",
    sclass : "VI",
    rollno : 12 
};

let keys = Object.keys(student);
keys.forEach((key) => {
    console.log(key);
})


// Just for learning purposes
let values = Object.values(student)
values.forEach(value => console.log(value))

// Use Object.values(obj) when you need to access the values of an object's properties. Please note that Object.values returns an array of those values

let entries = Object.entries(student)
entries.forEach(entry => (console.log(entry)))
// Use Object.entries(obj) This provides both keys and values, which is useful for situations where you need both the property names and their corresponding values. Itâ€™s particularly handy when you need to loop through both keys and values simultaneously.
